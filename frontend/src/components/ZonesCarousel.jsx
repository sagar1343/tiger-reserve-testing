        "On the northeastern boundary of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve lies Sarda Sagar, a large reservoir creating a 12 km natural border. When the water recedes 60-150 feet, it unveils a unique sandy beach, nestled at the foot of the great Sal forest. This scenic spot offers a peaceful retreat for nature lovers, with accommodations in tree huts, Tharu huts, or bamboo huts along the shore. Summer nights are enchanting, with moonlit waters and the sounds of nocturnal birds, while mornings come alive with the calls of peacocks and vibrant bird species. Winter brings many migratory birds, adding to the areaâ€™s allure.",
